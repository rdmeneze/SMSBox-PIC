/*
 *	Delay functions for HI-TECH C on the PIC18
 *
 *	Functions available:
 *		DelayUs(x)	Delay specified number of microseconds
 *		DelayMs(x)	Delay specified number of milliseconds
 *
 *	Note that there are range limits: 
 *	- on small values of x (i.e. x<10), the delay becomes less
 *	accurate. DelayUs is accurate with xtal frequencies in the
 * 	range of 4-16MHZ, where x must not exceed 255. 
 *	For xtal frequencies > 16MHz the valid range for DelayUs
 *	is even smaller - hence affecting DelayMs.
 *	To use DelayUs it is only necessary to include this file.
 *	To use DelayMs you must include delay.c in your project.
 *
 *	Set the crystal frequency in the CPP predefined symbols list
 *	on the PICC-18 commmand line, e.g.
 *	picc18 -DXTAL_FREQ=4MHZ
 *
 *	or
 *	picc18 -DXTAL_FREQ=100KHZ
 *	
 *	Note that this is the crystal frequency, the CPU clock is
 *	divided by 4.
 *
 *	MAKE SURE this code is compiled with full optimization!!!
